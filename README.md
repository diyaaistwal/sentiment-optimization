# sentiment-optimization
This project applies Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) to tune hyperparameters for an SVM model. Using the 20 Newsgroups dataset, it classifies text from two categories: rec.sport.baseball and sci.space. Features are extracted using TF-IDF, and model performance is evaluated with key metrics.
